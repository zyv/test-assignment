# How to spin it up

You need to install `make` and `Docker` on your machine.
Start your `Docker` daemon and run the following command.

```sh
make
```

If you want to watch changes, then just extend the make command with a simple `watch`.

```sh
make watch
```

You could also run `make open` to automatically open the website. Notice that this only works on `macOS`.

# Why so much over engineering?

This project is just a showcase. I want to demonstrate my skills with some principles and tools. If you want to implement this yourself, you should stick with `HTML/CSS` and some lines of plain `JavaScript`.
